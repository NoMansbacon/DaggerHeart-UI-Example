feature: Make a Spellcast Roll against a target within Close range. On a success, they become temporarily Enraptured. While Enraptured, a target’s attention is fixed on you, narrowing their field of view and drowning out any sound but your voice. Once per rest on a success, you can mark a Stress to force the Enraptured target to mark a Stress as well.
