feature: You can peek into the minds of others. Spend a Hope to read the vague surface thoughts of a target within Far range. Make a Spellcast Roll against the target to delve for deeper, more hidden thoughts. On a roll with Fear, the target might, at the GM’s discretion, become aware that you’re reading their thoughts.
