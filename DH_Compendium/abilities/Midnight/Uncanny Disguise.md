feature: When you have a few minutes to prepare, you can mark a Stress to don the facade of any humanoid you can picture clearly in your mind. While disguised, you have advantage on Presence Rolls to avoid scrutiny. Place a number of tokens equal to your Spellcast trait on this card. When you take an action while disguised, spend a token from this card. After the action that spends the last token is resolved, the disguise drops.
