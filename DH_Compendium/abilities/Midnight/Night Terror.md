feature: Once per long rest, choose any targets within Very Close range to perceive you as a nightmarish horror. The targets must succeed on a Reaction Roll (16) or become temporarily Horrified. While Horrified, they’re Vulnerable. Steal a number of Fear from the GM equal to the number of targets that are Horrified (up to the number of Fear in the GM’s pool). Roll a number of d6s equal to the number of stolen Fear and deal the total damage to each Horrified target. Discard the stolen Fear.
