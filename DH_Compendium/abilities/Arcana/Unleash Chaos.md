tokens: 5
feature: At the beginning of a session, place a number of tokens equal to your Spellcast trait on this card. Make a Spellcast Roll against a target within Far range and spend any number of tokens to channel raw energy from within yourself to unleash against them. On a success, roll a number of d10s equal to the tokens you spent and deal that much magic damage to the target. Mark a Stress to replenish this card with tokens (up to your Spellcast trait). At the end of each session, clear all unspent tokens.
