level: 8
stress: 2
feature: Mark a Stress to cast a protective aura on a target within Very Close range. When the target marks an Armor Slot, they reduce the severity of the attack by an additional threshold. If this spell causes a creature who would be damaged to instead mark no Hit Points, the effect ends. You can only hold Shield Aura on one creature at a time.
