feature: When you successfully make an attack with your weapon, you never deal damage beneath a target’s Major damage threshold (the target always marks a minimum of 2 Hit Points). Additionally, when a creature within your weapon’s range deals damage to an ally with an attack that doesn’t include you, you can mark a Stress to force them to make a Reaction Roll (15). On a failure, the target must mark a Hit Point.
