feature: You can speak the language of the natural world. When you want to speak to the plants and animals around you, make an Instinct Roll (12). On a success, they’ll give you the information they know. On a roll with Fear, their knowledge might be limited or come at a cost. Additionally, before you make a Spellcast Roll while within a natural environment, you can spend a Hope to gain a +2 bonus to the roll.
